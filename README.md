A. Instructions for how to compile and run the software
Compile the Application:
•	Execute the command prompt or terminal and open it.
•	The path to the RecipeConsoleApp directory is the one you need to go. cs file.
•	Use the C# compiler (usually csc) to compile the application
Run the Application:
•	Once the compilation is done, an executable file ( RecipeConsoleApp. exe on Windows or RecipeConsoleApp on Linux/Mac) will be generated in the same directory.
Run the executable:
RecipeConsoleApp. exe
or 
. /RecipeConsoleApp
Interacting with the Application:
•	The program, once you have started it, will show a welcome message and a menu with the options that you can choose from.
•	Use the numeric keys to select different options:Use the numeric keys to select different options: 
1: Enter Recipe Details
2: View Recipe
3: Scale Recipe 
4: Reset Quantities
5: Clear Recipe 
6: Exit
•	Apply the suggestions to the options showing the details of the recipe, searching the recipes, resizing the recipes, clearing the quantities, deleting the recipes, or quitting the application.
Follow the Prompts:
•	The use of the application will show you the steps, which you can enter the recipe details, look at the recipes, do various things with the recipes and deal with any error or exception that may happen.
Exit the Application:
•	Out of the application, press option 6 from the menu.


Using Directive:
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
This line imports the necessary namespace for MSTest framework, which provides the testing capabilities for this code.

Namespace Declaration:
namespace RecipeConsoleApp.Tests
The tests are organized within the RecipeConsoleApp.Tests namespace. This is good practice for keeping test classes separate from the main application code.

Test Fixture Declaration:
[TestFixture]
public class RecipeTests
The [TestFixture] attribute indicates that this class contains a set of test methods. In this case, it's named RecipeTests, and it will contain test cases for the Recipe class.

Test Methods:

CalculateTotalCalories_ReturnsCorrectTotal:
This test method verifies that the CalculateTotalCalories method of the Recipe class returns the correct total calories for a recipe with multiple ingredients.
CalculateTotalCalories_ReturnsZeroForEmptyRecipe:
This test method checks if the CalculateTotalCalories method returns zero for an empty recipe.
CalculateTotalCalories_ReturnsCorrectTotalForSingleIngredient:
This test method ensures that the CalculateTotalCalories method works correctly when there's only one ingredient in the recipe.
Test Execution:

Arrange:
In each test method, an instance of the Recipe class is created, and ingredients are added to it. This step sets up the necessary preconditions for the test.
Act:
The CalculateTotalCalories method of the Recipe instance is called to calculate the total calories.
Assert:
The calculated total calories are compared against expected values using assertions (Assert.AreEqual). If the calculated result matches the expected result, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.
